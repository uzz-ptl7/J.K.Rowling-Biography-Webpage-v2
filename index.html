    <li><p>J.K. Rowling at a book signing in
        2007, the year that the final book in
        the series, Harry Potter and the
        Deathly Hallows, was published.</p></li>
    <li><p>The first book in the Harry Potter series,
             Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (1997; also published as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone),
             was released under the name J.K. Rowling.
              (Her publisher recommended a gender-neutral pen name; born Joanne Rowling, she used J.K., adding the middle name Kathleen.)
            The book was an immediate success, appealing to both
            children, who were its intended audience, and adults.</p></li>
    <li><p>Featuring vivid descriptions and an imaginative story line, it followed the adventures of the
        unlikely hero Harry Potter, a lonely orphan who discovers that he is actually a wizard and
        enrolls in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The book received numerous
        awards, including the British Book Award. Succeeding volumes—Harry Potter and the
        Chamber of Secrets (1998), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Harry Potter
        and the Goblet of Fire (2000), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003), and Harry
        Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005)—also were best sellers, available in more than 200
        countries and some 60 languages. The seventh and final novel in the series, Harry Potter and
        the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007.</p></li>

    <h2><li><u>HARRY POTTER ON THE BIG SCREEN AND ON STAGE</u></li></h2>
    <li><p>The Harry Potter series sparked great enthusiasm among children and was credited with
        generating a new interest in reading. Film versions of the books were released in 2001–11 and
        became some of the top-grossing movies in the world. In addition, Rowling wrote the
        companion volumes Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them (2001), which was adapted into
        a film series (2016, 2018) that featured screenplays by Rowling; Quidditch Through the Ages
        (2001); and The Tales of Beedle the Bard (2008)—all of which originated as books read by
        Harry Potter and his friends within the fictional world of the series. Proceeds from their sales
        were donated to charity.</p></li>
    <li><p>She later cowrote a story that became the basis for the play Harry Potter and the Cursed
        Child, which premiered in 2016 and was a critical and commercial success, winning an
        unprecedented nine Olivier Awards, including best new play. In the production, Harry is a
        husband and father but is still struggling with his past, while his son Albus must contend with
        his father’s legacy. A book version of the script, which was advertised as the eighth story in
        the Harry Potter series, was published in 2016. Two years later the play transferred to
        Broadway, and in 2018 it won six Tony Awards, including best new play.</p></li>

    <h2><li><u>WRITING FOR ADULTS</u></li></h2>
    <li><p>Rowling made her first foray into adult fiction with The Casual Vacancy (2012; TV
        miniseries 2015), a contemporary social satire set in a small English town. In 2013 it was
        revealed that the author had penned the crime novel The Cuckoo’s Calling, using the
        pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The Silkworm—the second book in the series, which centred on
        the detective Cormoran Strike, a down-on-his-luck war veteran—was released in 2014. </p></li>
    <li><p>Later installments included Career of Evil (2015), Lethal White (2018), Troubled Blood (2020), and
        The Ink Black Heart (2022). A television series based on the books premiered in the United
        Kingdom in 2017 and in the United States the following year. In May 2020, during the
        COVID-19 pandemic, Rowling began serializing a new children’s book, The Ickabog, for free
        online; it was published in November. She described the fairy tale, which was unrelated to
        Harry Potter, as an exploration of “truth and the abuse of power.” She later published The
        Christmas Pig (2021), about a boy who loses his favourite toy and then embarks on a
        fantastical quest to find it.</p></li>
    <hr>

    <h2><li><u>HONORS AND CONTROVERSY</u></li></h2>
    <li><p>Rowling was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2001. In 2009
        she was named a chevalier of the French Legion of Honour.</p></li>
    <li><p>However, in June 2020, Rowling drew unaccustomed criticism for taking exception on social
        media to an article that referenced “people who menstruate.” In part, Rowling tweeted
        ‘People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help
        me out.” Rowling’s comments were seen as being unsympathetic to or out of touch with the
        transgender community. Some of the actors in the Harry Potter series, including Daniel
        Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson publicly opposed the author, while others,
        including Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, and Robbie Coltrane expressed support.</p></li>
